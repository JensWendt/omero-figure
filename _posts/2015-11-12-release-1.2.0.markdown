I am pleased to announce release of OMERO.figure 1.2.0.
This release introduces support for ROIs on figure panels.

Many of the new ROI features are described in the [previous blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015/11/09/try-new-roi-features-on-the-demo-app.html) and a full demonstration of these new features can be viewed below:
