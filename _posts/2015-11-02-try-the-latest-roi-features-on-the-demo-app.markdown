As you may have heard, we are currently adding ROI support to OMERO.figure, allowing
you to draw ROIs on image panels and copy & paste these between images.
This post describes the new features, invites you to try them out on the demo app
and provide feedback ahead of their inclusion in the next release. 

<h2>Adding ROIs to image panels</h2>

To add ROIs to panels in the figure, select a single panel, click on the "Labels" tab
and then click on the "Draw" button under the ROIs header.
This will launch the ROI viewer, where you can draw, edit and delete a number of ROI
types; Currently we support Rectangles, Lines, Arrows and Ellipses. 

Drawing and editing of ROIs should "just work" as you expect it to: Select the type
of ROI in the toolbar, as well as the line width and colour. Then draw the ROI on the image.
You can also use the "select" arrow to select and edit existing ROIs.

You can also copy, paste and delete ROIs using the "Edit" menu options or keyboard shortcuts.
Click "OK" at the bottom of the viewer to save changes to ROIs and close the viewer.


<h2>Copy, Paste & Edit ROIs without opening the viewer</h2>

In the "Labels" tab, you can Copy, Paste and Delete all the ROIs on the selected
image panels using the relevant buttons, without having to open the ROI viewer.
This allows you to duplicate the ROIs from one image panel to another.

You can also bulk edit the ROIs on selected images, changing the line width
or colour of all ROIs at once.
