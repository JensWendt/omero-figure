OMERO has 'groups' of users and the permissions of each group
can be set to allow other group members to view each other's data.

In this case, other members of your group will be able to see your figures
when they go to the File > Open dialog in OMERO.figure.
It's also possible to send them the url of the figure you want
to share. If they have permission to view it they can
simply follow the link, log-in and view the figure.

They will be able to explore and edit your figure in the
same way as you can, but will not be able to save 
their changes. However, they will be able to save thier own copy
of the figure.
