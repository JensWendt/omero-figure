This site has a demo version of OMERO.figure that you can
try without needing to install the app or require an OMERO.server.
It uses data hosted by the JCB data-viewer, which is a
public OMERO server with a custom UI.

TODO:
	never ask to "Save?" on exit
	export as json to save on github
	Add 'use JCB image-viewer urls' in "Add Iamge" dialog
