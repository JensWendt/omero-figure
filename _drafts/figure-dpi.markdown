Journals have specific requirements for "publication quality" figures,
particularly in terms of pixel resolution.
Resolution is the density of pixels or 'dots' when the figure is
printed, usually measured in 'dots per inch' (dpi).

In order to avoid a pixelated appearance when figures are displayed
at their published size, images must have sufficiently high resolution,
usually 300 dpi or above.


OMERO.figure dpi
================

The concept of "dots per inch" only has a meaning once you know the physical size
of your figure. In OMERO.figure, the default page size is A4 (210 x 297 mm) but 
you can specify the size of your page under Menu: File > Paper Setup... 
We can then use this size to calculate dpi for all images in the figure.
