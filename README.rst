OMERO.figure
============

OMERO.web app for creating figures from images in OMERO.

For full details see http://figure.openmicroscopy.org


Requirements
============

* OMERO 5.2.6 or newer.

Installation
============

Install OMERO.web.

This app installs into the OMERO.web framework.

::

    $ pip install omero-figure

Add figure custom app to your installed web apps:

::

    $ bin/omero config append omero.web.apps '"omero_figure"'

Display a link to 'Figure' at the top of the webclient:

::

    $ bin/omero config append omero.web.ui.top_links '["Figure", "figure_index", {"title": "Open Figure in new tab", "target": "figure"}]' 

Now restart OMERO.web as normal.

**Warning**:

OMERO.figure version 2.x is meant to be installed into OMERO.web **5.2.6 or newer**
This is due to Django Framework compatibility and a package re-organization required to distribute the application using Python Package Manager PyPi.


Enabling PDF generation
-----------------------

This following steps need to perform where the OMERO.server is running.

* Install `reportlab <https://bitbucket.org/rptlab/reportlab>`_ PDF python package:

::

    $ pip install reportlab

* Install script to generate figure. To perform this task, you must be an admin.

The following steps assume that the OMERO.server is already running.

- Go to the directory where ``omero_figure`` has been installed, this could be on a different machine.
- Go to ``/omero_figure/scripts``
- Upload, if not already installed, the script as an official script:

::

    $ path/to/OMERO.server/bin/omero script upload omero/figure_scripts/Figure_To_Pdf.py --official

Alternatively, before starting the OMERO.server:

- Go to the directory where ``omero_figure`` has been installed, this could be on a different machine.
- Copy ``/omero_figure/scripts/omero/figure_scripts/Figure_To_Pdf.py`` to ``path/to/OMERO.server/lib/scripts/omero/figure_scripts``
- Restart the OMERO.server

* Optional: Figure legends can be formatted using Markdown syntax. To see this correctly in the exported PDF info page, we need `Python Markdown <https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/index.html>`_ installed:

::

    $ pip install markdown

Development
===========

We use Grunt for various tools.
See http://figure.openmicroscopy.org/2014/05/01/testing-with-jshint-jasmine-grunt.html
for an introduction.

Install Node from https://nodejs.org, then:

::

    $ cd omero-figure
    $ npm install

Install Grunt CLI as described on http://gruntjs.com/using-the-cli.

To compile jst templates:

::

	$ grunt jst

To concatenate js files into a single figure.js file that is used in the app:

::

    $ grunt concat

During development, you'll want to have both of these run whenever the relevant files are edited.
This can be achieved with:

::

	$ grunt watch

To update the demo figure app at http://figure.openmicroscopy.org/demo/
we have a grunt task that concats and moves js files into demo/.
It also replaces Django template tags in index.html and various js code
fragments with static app code. This is all handled by the grunt task:

::

    $ grunt demo

This puts everything into the omero-figure/demo/ directory.
This can be tested locally via:

::

    $ cd demo/
    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Go to http://localhost:8000/ to test it.
This will not install the script and dependencies required to export the figure
as PDF.

To update the figure.openmicroscopy.org site:

- Copy the demo directory and replace the demo directory in gh-pages-staging branch.
- Commit changes and open PR against ome/gh-pages-staging as described https://github.com/ome/omero-figure/tree/gh-pages-staging

It is also possible to run the demo in docker without installing anything locally:

::

    $ docker build -t figure-demo .
    $ docker run -ti --rm -p 8000:8000 figure-demo
